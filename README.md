# Elements

Elements is a framework for building small 3D games and demos.
It utilises OpenGL via the LWJGL2 wrapper.

This project started due to an university assignment to learn OpenGL.

For now the framework is still incomplete, but most OpenGL constructs have been abstracted into Java classes.
